                    People put a lot of time and effort into their builds, this is a <i>relatively</i> peaceful server, so don't go destroying it.<br><br>
                    On top of that, we also appreciate having a landscape that isn't horrible to look at, so don't go around destroying that either.<br><br>
                    Beyond that, a respect for integrity includes, but is NOT limited to; not griefing, not stealing, not lava casting, and refraining from blowing shit up.

                    Nobody likes it when one person on the server just goes out of their way to ruin the experience for others, the server is made for people to have fun so if you want to be an asshole I would suggest joining '2b2t.org' (the OLDEST ANARCHY SERVER IN MINECRAFT)<br><br>
                    This rule extends to hate speech, slander, bastardly acts, slurs, euphemisms for slurs and mean comments that hurt my feelings.<br><br>
                    Remember Mojang enforces this rule as well and I doubt you want to get banned from Minecraft.

                    The punishment for breaking any of these rules tends to vary depending on the severity; generally it would be a temporary ban from the server but if you are a repeat offender you may be permanently banned from the server<br><br>

                    Do keep in mind that these rules can be updated at anytime
